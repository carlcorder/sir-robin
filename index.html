Conway in 1970. The Game of Life consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, each 
of which is in one of two possible states: dead or alive. Every cell interacts with its 
eight neighbors and at each step in time, the following rules apply:</p><ol><li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.</li><li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li><li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li><li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li></ol><p>
From these four <em>simple</em> rules, many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns">interesting patterns</a> can evolve. For example, the <strong>glider</strong> moves across the grid at a diagonal, much like the ‚ôù Bishop on a chess 
board:</p><img src="static/images/glider.gif" style="width:75px;display:block;margin:30px auto" idyll="[object Object]"/><p>The glider is a simple pattern that belongs to a more general class of patterns known 
as spaceships. A <em>spaceship</em> is any pattern that reappears after a certain number of 
generations in the same orientation but in a different position.</p><p>A <em>knightship</em> is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves up, 
similar to the ‚ôû Knight on a chess board. It may surprise you to learn that the first true
knightship was only <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Sir_Robin">recently discovered</a>, nearly 50 years after the 
game‚Äôs creation!</p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5BWuQoI6L8ES73BIG0/giphy.gif" alt="brave-sir-robin"/><p><strong>Sir Robin</strong> was found by <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Adam_P._Goucher">Adam Goucher</a> on March 6th, 2018 using a 
searching program that extends partials. A partial is simply an intermediate object that might be 
used as part of a spaceship. Of course, partials themselves are not spaceships. They 
lack the key feature of being periodic. But, some come very close. Such as the <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Almost_knightship">Almost Knightship</a> 
which was found back in 2004.</p><img src="static/images/almost-knightship.png" style="width:300px;display:block;margin:30px auto" idyll="[object Object]"/><p>Generation 0 (<code>left</code>) and generation 6 (<code>right</code>) show that the pattern is different by 
only two cells at the top right. So close!</p><h2>Creating Sir Robin using üëë regl</h2><p><a href="http://regl.party/">Regl</a> is a functional abstraction for wegbl with a data-driven style inspired by React.</p><p>Starting with the <a href="https://github.com/regl-project/regl/blob/gh-pages/example/life.js">life.js</a> example:</p><div class=" regl"></div><p>I created several helper functions to parse <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/RLE">RLE</a> strings into <code>INITIAL_CONDITIONS</code> for
